# Notes

## Data Types
* Numbers (40, 1.3, 6969696...)
* Strings ("Steve", "is", "dumb"...)
* Arrays (index access available => arr[0] returns the first item of arr)

## Functions
Functions (inherently "methods" due to being defined within a class body) can be
called from any object in Ruby, but only certain methods work on certain objects.

### Out of the Box Functions
* <String>_.length_ - prints the length of a string. Does not work on numbers!
* <String>_.gsub(arg1, arg2)_ - "global substitute" replaces all instances of arg1 in the String with arg2.
* <String>_.lines_ - converts a string to an array of its contents. Each item represents a block of characters that are followed by a newline.
* <String/Array>_.reverse_ - reverses the attributes of an object. Does not work on numbers
* <Array>_.max_ - prints the greatest item of an array of numbers.
* <Array>_.sort_ - sorts the contents of an array of numbers.
* _.to_s_ - attempts to convert a non-string to a string.
* _.to_i_ - attempts to convert something to an integer.
* _.to_a_ - attempts to convert something to an array.

### Bang! (!)
{% highlight ruby %}
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers   # => [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers.sort
numbers   # => [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers.sort!
numbers   # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 66]
{% endhighlight %}
