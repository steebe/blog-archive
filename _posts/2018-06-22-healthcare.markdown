# How Privatized Healthcare is Just Universal Healthcare That's Ripping You Off

## How it works

In figure 1-1, the following phenomena is displayed:

    A.) Employers and Individuals contribute to various companies within the
    private Healthcare entity. The prices that are paid are based on three
    factors:
        1. The plan chosen
        2. A formulaic cost of the plan, calculated by various statistics*
        aggregated by the company
        3. The margins the company wishes to make
    B.) The companies within this entity pay the healthcare costs of their
    covered individuals that require services.

At a _very_ high level, the private healthcare system is a black box whose input
is cash and whose output is far less cash. It's a highly profitable entity whose
revenue is directly attributed to the statistics that only a minute few of the
participating "customers" will require services that cost more than their
individual contribution to the revenue.

\* The number of people per year who require surgeries over $4,500, the amount
of people who have a congenital heart disease and the number of injury-causing
automobile incidents every month, to name a few.

## Who it benefits
From the surface, it

Scratch:
- The companies that make up the private healthcare entity (duh)
- Politicians that are catered to by lobbyers of the healthcare entity
    - ```TODO: sources```

## Who it hurts
- The people that pay the healthcare entity
- The people that cannot afford the healthcare entity
- The employers that compete to offer healthcare options to employees
    - ```TODO: sources```
