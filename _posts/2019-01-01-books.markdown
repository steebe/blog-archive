1. Chapter two, "Religion Kills", of _God is Not Great - How Religion Poisons Everything_ by Christopher Hitchens.
  - "It [religion] may speak about the bliss of the next world, but it wants power in this one.", "The true believer cannot rest until the whole world bows the knee."
  - Sectarianism is a major theme in this chapter. Hitchens wants to make it clear that the rivalries created by sects is the first step that religion takes to start its killing process. Sects breed their own toxic subculture to propagate nothing but anti-other ideology.
  - Many personal experiences were used to back up his claims in this chapter, and digesting each of them was crucial to tying the chapter together. There were a few moments where I felt as though he was enjoying simply sharing his wealth of experience during his research phases, but ultimately the stories all added up to become a powerful tool at summing up "Religion Kills".
  - My opinion that religion was first and foremost, and remains to be, a tool used on and against lesser privileged or less educated peoples was solidified by this chapter. Ideology seems the perfect distractor and unifier that can be leveraged by those who wish to maintain power over a group.
