# Go
Go, the prodigal brainchild of various engineers, community enthusiasts (Gophers) and brilliant language/compiler developers, is perhaps Google's best contribution to the Computer Science field.

### Important Packages
_os_ - contains the go code available for interacting with the operating system hosting a go executable
* _os_.**Args** - a slice of strings that represent the command line arguments passed into a Go application's runtime environment

### Lingo
_slice_ - a dynamically sized sequence of array elements. Individual elements
can be accessed as
{% highlight Go %}
mySlice[i]
{% endhighlight %}
...chunks can be accessed as
{% highlight Go %}
mySlice[m:n]
{% endhighlight %}
...and the length is reported with
{% highlight Go %}
len(mySlice)
{% endhighlight %}

### Conventions

_zero values_ - any variable that's not defined in its declaration takes what's called a "zero value"
* **string** --> "" (empty string)
* numeric types --> 0

_:=_ - the "short variable declaration" is the operator used in a statement to declare one or more variables and give them appropriate types based on the initializer value
{% highlight Go %}x := 2 // initializes x to 2{% endhighlight %}

## Updating Go
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
# Download latest tar from distribution (https://golang.org/dl/)
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf <path-to-tarball>
# Edit GOROOT, GOPATH and PATH
$ echo $PATH | grep "/usr/local/go/bin"
{% endhighlight %}
