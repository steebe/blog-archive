I'm Steve Bass. I write software for a living, pretend to write music for fun and neglect my own writings here until I find inspiration. The former usually comes in the form of a wave of cynicism for the world around me and the various things I have let into my life.

You can find out more about me at my main site and the social sites that the rest of the world seems to be fawning over:
